      <pThis document is the formal specification for TEI simplePrint, an entry-level customization of
        the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines, intended to be generally useful to a large
        variety of encoders attempting to cope with the standardized representation of a variety of
        documents in digital form./>
      <pLike every other TEI customization, TEI simplePrint was designed for use with a particular type
        of material. If the material you are planning to encode matches the following criteria, then
        TEI simplePrint is for you. If it does not, it may not be. ><list
          ><itemYou are encoding print material, rather than manuscript: simplePrint provides no way of
            encoding manuscript features such as correction, deletion, or scribal variation/>
          <itemYou are encoding material from the Early Modern period (i.e., up to the end of the
            nineteenth century): some of the features for which simplePrint provides encodings are rarely
            found in modern materials./>
          <itemYou are encoding material written, broadly speaking, within the Western European
            tradition, using largely Western European characters. simplePrint does provide facilities for
            encoding short passages in non Western European languages, but many features needed to
            cope with Asian or ancient scripts are missing. />
          <itemYour intention is to provide a relatively simple encoding for a large amount of
            material, rather than a rich encoding of a small amount of material: simplePrint is intended
            to help libraries and archives wishing to go beyond basic digital facsimiles, rather
            than to support specialist research. It does not, for example, include features for
            detailed linguistic tagging beyond simple word-level tagging, nor for specialised text
            types such as dictionaries, historical or biographical databases, etc. />
        </list> If your needs go beyond those summarized here, simplePrint may still be a good point of
        departure, and may be very useful as a basis for the creation of your own TEI customisation.
        We don't however discuss the creation of a TEI customization in this document: the TEI
        website provides a number of links to tutorial material and tools which may assist in this
        process. </p>
      <pThe present document is intended to be generally comprehensible and accessible, but does
        assume some knowledge of XML (the encoding language used by the TEI), and of the way it is
        used by the TEI. Further information on both these topics are available from many places,
        not least the TEI's own web site at ><ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org"/>.</p>
      <pThe TEI simplePrint schema was first elaborated as a part of the TEI Simple project funded by the
        ><ref target="https://mellon.org/"Andrew W. Mellon Foundation/> (2012-2014). The project sought
        to define a new <soCalledhighly-constrained and prescriptive subset/> of the Text Encoding
        Initiative (TEI) Guidelines suited to the representation of early modern print materials, a
        formally-defined set of processing rules which permit modern web applications to easily present
        and analyze the encoded texts, mapping to other ontologies, and processes to describe the encoding
        status and richness of a TEI digital text. Its choice of elements reflected the practices followed
        in the encoding of large-scale literary archives, notably those produced by the Text Creation
        Partnership. Practice of other comparable archives such as the German Text Archive was also taken
        into account.</p>
      <pThe most distinctive feature of TEI simplePrint is its use of the TEI Processing Model, which
        provides explicit and recommended options for the display or processing of every textual
        element. Programmers developing systems to handle texts encoded with TEI simplePrint do not have
        to look beyond this when building stylesheets or other components. This greatly reduces the
        complexity of developing applications that will work reliably and consistently for many
        users and across large corpora of documents./>
      <pThe TEI simplePrint schema and the TEI Processing Model were first defined by a working group
        led by Martin Mueller (Northwestern University) and Sebastian Rahtz (Oxford University).
        Major contributions to the project were made by Magdalena Turska (Oxford University), James
        Cummings (Oxford University), and Brian Pytlik Zillig. The changes to the TEI scheme needed
        to support the TEI Processing Model were reviewed and approved by the TEI Technical Council
        for inclusion in release 3.0.0 of TEI P5 in February 2016. The present document was
        extensively revised and extended by Lou Burnard in July 2016 for submission to the TEI
        Technical Council. />

        ><headA Short Example/>
        <pWe begin with a short example. How should we go about transferring into a computer a
          passage of prose, such as the start of the last chapter of Charlotte Brontë's novel
            ><titleJane Eyre/>? We might start by simply copying what we see on the printed
          page, typing it in such a way that what appears on the screen looks as similar as
          possible, for example, by retaining the original line breaks, by introducing blanks to
          represent the layout of the original headings, page breaks, and paragraphs, and so forth.
          Of course, the possibilities are limited by the nature of the computer program we use to
          capture the text: it may not be possible for example to reflect accurately the typographic
          characteristics of our source with all such software. Some characters in the printed text
          (such as the accented letter <mentioneda/> in <mentionedfaàl/> or
          the long dash) may not be available on the keyboard; some typographic distinctions (such
          as that between small capitals and full capitals) may not be readily accessible. Our first
          attempt tries to mimic the appearance of the former, and simply ignores the latter.</p>

                                CHAPTER 38

READER, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the par-
son and clerk, were alone present. When we got back from church, I
went into the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking
the dinner, and John cleaning the knives, and I said --
  'Mary, I have been married to Mr Rochester this morning.' The
housekeeper and her husband were of that decent, phlegmatic
order of people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a
remarkable piece of news without incurring the danger of having
one's ears pierced by some shrill ejaculation and subsequently stunned
by a torrent of wordy wonderment. Mary did look up, and she did
stare at me; the ladle with which she was basting a pair of chickens
roasting at the fire, did for some three minutes hang suspended in air,
and for the same space of time John's knives also had rest from the
polishing process; but Mary, bending again over the roast, said only --
   'Have you, miss? Well, for sure!'
   A short time after she pursued, 'I seed you go out with the master,
but I didn't know you were gone to church to be wed'; and she
basted away. John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to
ear.
   'I telled Mary how it would be,' he said: 'I knew what Mr Ed-
ward' (John was an old servant, and had known his master when he
was the cadet of the house, therefore he often gave him his Christian
name) -- 'I knew what Mr Edward would do; and I was certain he
would not wait long either: and he's done right, for aught I know. I
wish you joy, miss!' and he politely pulled his forelock.
   'Thank you, John. Mr Rochester told me to give you and Mary
this.'
   I put into his hand a five-pound note.  Without waiting to hear
more, I left the kitchen. In passing the door of that sanctum some time
after, I caught the words --
   'She'll happen do better for him nor ony o' t' grand ladies.' And
again, 'If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faa\l, and varry
good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see
that.'
   I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what
I had done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted. Diana and

                            474

                 JANE EYRE                      475

Mary approved the step unreservedly. Diana announced that she
would just give me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she
would come and see me.
   'She had better not wait till then, Jane,' said Mr Rochester, when I
read her letter to him; 'if she does, she will be too late, for our honey-
moon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your
grave or mine.'
   How St John received the news I don't know: he never answered
the letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote
to me, without, however, mentioning Mr Rochester's name or allud-
ing to my marriage. His letter was then calm, and though very serious,
kind. He has maintained a regular, though not very frequent correspond-
ence ever since: he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who
live without God in the world, and only mind earthly things.

              rendered by ad hoc keying conventions (<mentionedfaa\l/>) which follow no
              standard pattern and will be processed correctly only if the transcriber remembers to
              mention them in the documentation;</item>
            <itemparagraph divisions are marked only by the use of white space, and hard carriage
              returns have been introduced at the end of each line. Consequently, if the size of

          example, each paragraph is marked by a tag <tagp/> at its start, and a corresponding
            <tag/p/> at its end. We don't elaborate further on the syntax of TEI XML here.
            <note place="foot"Many introductory tutorials on XML are available on the web, for
            example at ><ptr target="http://www.w3schools.com/xml/"/>. The way the TEI uses XML is
            fully documented in <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SG.html"section v of the
              TEI Guidelines/>; a very basic introduction to TEI XML is also available at <ptr target="http://www.ultraslavonic.info/intro-to-xml"/>. The formal specification of the
            XML language is at <ptr target="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml"/>.</note>
        </p>
        <pAside from its syntax, it is important to note that this particular encoding represents a
          set of choices or priorities. We have chosen to prioritize and simplify the representation
          of the words of the text over the representation of the typographic layout associated with
          them in this source document. This makes it easier for a computer to answer questions
          about the words in the document than about its typesetting, reflecting our research
          priorities. This priority also leads us to suppress end-of-line hyphenation. Conceivably
          Brontë (or her printer) intended the word ><qhoneymoon/> to appear as <qhoney-moon/>
          on its second appearance, though this seems unlikely: our decision to focus on Brontë's
          text, rather than on the printing of it in this particular edition, makes it impossible to
          be certain. Similarly, our decision makes it impossible to use this transcription as a
          means of statistically analysing hyphenation practice. An encoding makes explicit all and
          only those textual features of importance to the encoder.</p>
        <pIt is not difficult to think of ways in which the encoding of even this short passage
          might readily be extended to address other research priorities. For example: ><list type="simple"
            ><itema regularized form of the passages in dialect could be provided; />
            <itemfootnotes glossing or commenting on any passage could be added;/>
            <itempointers linking parts of this text to others could be added;/>
            <itemproper names of various kinds could be distinguished from the surrounding
              text;/>
            <itemnames could be classified as personal, geographical, or institutional/>
            <itemdetailed bibliographic information about the text's provenance and context could
              be prefixed to it;/>
            <itema linguistic analysis of the passage into sentences, clauses, words, etc., could
              be provided, each unit being associated with appropriate category codes;/>
            <itemthe text could be segmented into narrative or discourse units;/>
            <itemsystematic analysis or interpretation of the text could be included in the
              encoding, with potentially complex alignment or linkage between the text and the
              analysis, or between the text and one or more translations of it;/>
            <itempassages in the text could be linked to images or sound held on other
              media./>
          </list>
                </p>
        <pIn the remainder of this document, we present a number of TEI-recommended ways of
          supporting these and other encoding requirements. These ways generally involve the
          application of specific TEI XML elements, selected from the full range of possibilities
          documented in the TEI ><titleGuidelines/>. Like every other TEI project, TEI Simple
          proposes a view of the TEI Guidelines. This document defines and documents that view. </p>
      </div>
      <div xml:id="Simple-struc"
        ><headThe Structure of a TEI simplePrint Document/>
        <pA TEI-conformant text contains (a) a ><termTEI header/> (marked up as a
            <giteiHeader/> element) and (b) one or more representations of a text. These
          representations may be of three kinds: a transcribed text, marked up as a <gitext/>
          element; a collection of digital images representing the text, marked up using a
            <gifacsimile/> element; or a literal transcription of one or more documents
          instantiating the text, marked up using the <gisourceDoc/> element.</p>
        <pThese elements are combined together to form a single ><giTEI/> element, which must be
          declared within the TEI <termnamespace/>, and therefore usually takes the form
            <tagTEI xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"/>
          <note place="foot"A ><termnamespace/> is an XML concept. Its function is to identify
            the vocabulary from which a group of element names are drawn, using a standard
            identifier resembling a web address. The namespace for TEI elements is
              <valhttp://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0/>
                    </note>.</p>
        <pSome aspects of the TEI header are described in more detail in section ><ptr target="#Simple-header"/>. In what follows, we will focus chiefly on the use of the
            <gitext/> element, though we describe one way of using the <gifacsimile/>
          element in combination with it or alone in section <ptr target="#Simple-fax"/>. We do not
          consider the <gisourceDoc/> element further, since it is mainly used in very
          specialised applications for which TEI simplePrint would not be appropriate. </p>
        <pA text may be ><termunitary/> (a single work) or <termcomposite/> (a
          collection of single works, such as an anthology). In either case, the text may have
          optional <termfront/> or <termback/> matter such as title pages, prefaces,
          appendixes etc. We use the term <termbody/> for whatever comes between these in the
          source document. We discuss various kinds of composite text in section <ptr target="#Simple-composite"/> below.</p>
        <pA unitary text will be encoded using an overall structure like this: ><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" valid="feasible"
                        ><TEI
              ><teiHeader><!-- [ TEI Header information ]  --></teiHeader>
              <text
                ><front><!-- [ front matter ... ] -->
                </front>
                <body
                  ><!-- [ body of text ... ]  -->
                </body>
                <back><!--  [ back matter ...  ] -->
                </back>
              </text>
            </TEI>
                    </egXML>
        </p>
        <pIn each of the following sections we include a short list of the TEI
            ><termelements/> under discussion, along with a brief description, and in most
          cases an example of how they are used. Throughout the text, element names are linked to
          their detailed reference documentation, as given in the TEI Guidelines. Note that most of
          the examples provided by the reference documentation, and all of the links, are not
          specific to TEI simplePrint. </p>
        <pFor example, here are the elements discussed so far: ><specList
            ><specDesc key="TEI"/>
            <specDesc key="teiHeader"/>
            <specDesc key="text"/>
            <specDesc key="facsimile"/>
          </specList>
                </p>
      </div>
      <div xml:id="Simple-body"
        ><headEncoding the Body/>
        <pAs indicated above, a unitary text is encoded by means of a ><gitext/> element, which
          may contain the following elements: <specList
            ><specDesc key="front"/>
            <specDesc key="group"/>
            <specDesc key="body"/>
            <specDesc key="back"/>
          </specList> Elements specific to front and back matter are described below in section <ptr target="#Simple-fronbac"/>. In this section we discuss the elements making up the body
          of a text. A text must always have a body.</p>
        <div xml:id="divs"
          ><headText Division Elements and Global Attributes/>
          <pThe body of a prose text may be just a series of paragraphs or similar blocks of text,
            or these may be grouped together into chapters, sections, subsections, etc. The
              ><gidiv/> element is used to represent any such grouping of blocks. <specList
              ><specDesc key="div" atts="type"/>
            </specList>
          </p>
          <pThe ><atttype/> attribute on the <gidiv/> element may be used to supply a
            conventional name for this category of text division in order to distinguish them.
            Typical values might be <valbook/>, <valchapter/>, <valsection/>,
              <valpart/>, <valpoem/>, <valsong/>, etc. TEI simplePrint does not constrain
            the range of values that may be used here. </p>
          <pA ><gidiv/> element may itself contain further, nested, <gidiv/>s, thus
            mimicking the traditional structure of a book, which can be decomposed hierarchically
            into units such as parts, containing chapters, containing sections, and so on. TEI texts
            in general conform to this simple hierarchic model.</p>
          <pHere as elsewhere the ><attxml:id/> attribute may be used to supply a unique
            identifier for the division, which may be used for cross references or other links to
            it, such as a commentary, as further discussed in section <ptr target="#Simple-ptrs"/>.
            It is good practice to provide an <attxml:id/> attribute for every major structural
            unit in a text, and to derive its values in some systematic way, for example by
            appending a section number to a short code for the title of the work in question, as in
            the examples below. </p>
          <pThe ><attn/> attribute may be used to supply (additionally or alternatively) a
            short mnemonic name or number for a division, or any other element. If a conventional
            form of reference or abbreviation for the parts of a work already exists (such as the
            book/chapter/verse pattern of Biblical citations), the <attn/> attribute is the
            place to record it; unlike the identifier supplied by the <attxml:id/> attribute,
            it does not need to be unique.</p>
          <pThe ><attxml:lang/> attribute may be used to specify the language of the division.
            Languages are identified by an internationally defined code, as further discussed in
            section <ptr target="#z636"/> below.</p>
          <pThe ><attrendition/> attribute may be used to supply information about the
            rendition (appearance) of a division, or any other element, as further discussed in
            section <ptr target="#Simple-hilites"/> below. Note that this attribute is used to
            describe the appearance of the <emphsource/> text, rather than the appearance of
            any intended output when the encoded text is displayed. The two may of course be
            similar, or identical, but the TEI does not assume or require this.</p>
          <pThese four attributes, ><attxml:id/>, <attn/>, <attxml:lang/>, and
              <attrendition/> are so widely useful that they are allowed on any element in any
            TEI schema: they are called <termglobal attributes/>. Other attributes defined in
            the TEI simplePrint schema are discussed in section <ptr target="#xatts"/>.</p>
          <pAs noted above, the value of every ><attxml:id/> attribute must be unique within a
            document. One simple way of ensuring this is to make it reflect the hierarchic structure
            of the document. For example, Smith's <titleWealth of Nations/> as first
            published consists of five books, each of which is divided into chapters, while some
            chapters are further subdivided into parts. We might define <attxml:id/> values for
            this structure as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" valid="feasible"
                            ><body
                ><div xml:id="WN1" n="I" type="book"
                  ><div xml:id="WN101" n="I.1" type="chapter"
                    ><!-- ... -->
                  </div>
                  <div xml:id="WN102" n="I.2" type="chapter"
                    ><!-- ... -->
                  </div>
                  <!-- ... -->
                  <div xml:id="WN110" n="I.10" type="chapter"
                    ><div xml:id="WN1101" n="I.10.1" type="part"
                      ><!-- ... -->
                    </div>
                    <div xml:id="WN1102" n="I.10.2" type="part"
                      ><!-- ... -->
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <!-- ... -->
                </div>
                <div xml:id="WN2" n="II" type="book"
                  ><!-- ... -->
                </div>
              </body>
                        </egXML>
          </p>
          <pA different numbering scheme may be used for ><attxml:id/> and <attn/>
            attributes: this is often useful where a canonical reference scheme is used which does
            not tally with the structure of the work. For example, in a novel divided into books
            each containing chapters, where the chapters are numbered sequentially through the whole
            work, rather than within each book, one might use a scheme such as the following: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" valid="feasible"
                            ><body
                ><div xml:id="TS01" n="1" type="volume"
                  ><div xml:id="TS011" n="1" type="chapter"
                    ><!-- ... -->
                  </div>
                  <div xml:id="TS012" n="2" type="chapter"
                    ><!-- ... -->
                                    </div>
                </div>
                <div xml:id="TS02" n="2" type="volume"
                  ><div xml:id="TS021" n="3" type="chapter"
                    ><!-- ... -->
                                    </div>
                  <div xml:id="TS022" n="4" type="chapter"
                    ><!-- ... -->
                                    </div>
                </div>
              </body>
                        </egXML> Here the work has two volumes, each containing two chapters. The
            chapters are numbered conventionally 1 to 4, but the <attxml:id/> values specified
            allow them to be regarded additionally as if they were numbered 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2.</p>
        </div>
        <div xml:id="h25"
          ><headHeadings and Closings/>
          <pEvery ><gidiv/> may have a title or heading at its start, and (less commonly) a
            trailer such as <qEnd of Chapter 1/> at its end. The following elements may be used
            to transcribe them: <specList
              ><specDesc key="head"/>
              <specDesc key="trailer"/>
            </specList> Some other elements which may be found at the beginning or ending of text
            divisions are discussed below in section <ptr target="#h52"/>.</p>
          <pWhether or not headings and trailers are included in a transcription is a matter for
            the individual transcriber to decide. Where a heading is completely regular (for example
              ><qChapter 1/>) or may be automatically constructed from attribute values (e.g.
              <tagdiv type="chapter" n="1"/>), it may be omitted; where it contains otherwise
            unrecoverable text it should always be included. For example, the start of Hardy's
              <titleUnder the Greenwood Tree/> might be encoded as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                            ><div xml:id="UGT1" n="Winter" type="part"
                ><div xml:id="UGT101" n="1" type="chapter"
                  ><headMellstock-Lane/>
                  <pTo dwellers in a wood almost every species of tree ... />
                </div>
              </div>
                        </egXML>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div xml:id="vedr"
          ><headTextual Components/>
          <pIn prose texts such as the Brontë example above, the divisions are generally composed
            of paragraphs, represented as ><gip/> elements, though in some circumstances it may
            be preferred to use the <soCalledanonymous block/> element <giab/>. In
            poetic or dramatic texts different elements are used, representing stanzas and verse
            lines in the first case, and individual speeches or stage directions in the second: <specList
              ><specDesc key="p"/>
              <specDesc key="ab"/>
              <specDesc key="l"/>
              <specDesc key="lg"/>
              <specDesc key="sp"/>
              <specDesc key="speaker"/>
              <specDesc key="stage"/>
            </specList>
          </p>
          <pWe discuss each of these kinds of component separately below./>
          <div
            ><headVerse/>
            <pHere, for example, is the start of a poetic text in which verse lines and stanzas are
              tagged: ><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                                ><lg n="I"
                  ><lI Sing the progresse of a deathlesse soule,/>
                  <lWhom Fate, with God made, but doth not controule,/>
                  <!-- ... -->
                  <lA worke t'out weare Seths pillars, bricke and stone,/>
                  <lAnd (holy writs excepted) made to yeeld to none,/>
                </lg>
                            </egXML>
            </p>
            <pNote that the ><gil/> element marks verse lines, not typographic lines: as
              elsewhere the original lineation of the source text is not therefore preserved by this
              encoding. The <gilb/> element described in section <ptr target="#Simple-pln"/>
              might additionally be used to mark typographic lines if so desired. </p>
            <pIn a poetic text it may also be considered useful to identify the rhymes, for which
              the following element may be used: ><specList
                ><specDesc key="rhyme" atts="label"/>
              </specList> The following example shows how this element might be used both to
              identify rhyming words or word parts and to assign each rhyme to a part of a rhyming
              pattern by means of its <attlabel/> attribute. The rhyming pattern here is
              specified by the <attrhyme/> attribute supplied on the <gilg/> representing
              the stanza within which the pattern operates: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                                ><lg rhyme="AABCCBBA"
                  ><lThe sunlight on the ><rhyme label="A"garden/>
                                    </l>
                  <l
                                        ><rhyme label="A"Harden/>s and grows <rhyme label="B"cold/>,</l>
                  <lWe cannot cage the ><rhyme label="C"minute/>

            <pA dramatic text contains speeches, which may be in prose or verse, and will also
              contain stage directions. The ><gisp/> element is used to represent each identified
              speech. It contains an optional speaker indication, marked with the <gispeaker/>
              element, which can be followed by one or more <gil/> or <gip/> elements,
              depending on whether the speech is considered to be in prose or in verse. Stage
              directions, whether within or between speeches, are marked using the <gistage/>
              element. </p>

            <pIn a verse drama, it is quite common to find that verse lines are split between

              dialogue concerned: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"

                            </egXML> Here the <attwho/> attribute values (<val#OPI/> etc.) are
              links, pointing to items in a list of the characters in the novel. In the case of a
              play, this list of characters might appear in the original source as a cast list or
              dramatic personae, which might be marked up using the <gicastList/> element
              described in section <ptr target="#specfronbac"/> below. Such a list would not, of
              course, be appropriate to provide descriptive information about each character, much
              of which does not appear in the original source. Instead a <giparticDesc/>
              (participant description) element should be provided in the TEI header, as further
              discussed in section <ptr target="#profDesc"/> below. </p>

          <div xml:id="abseg"
            ><headOther Kinds of Text Block/>
            <pAs mentioned above, the ><giab/> element may also be used in preference to the
                <gip/> element. It should be used for blocks of text which are not clearly
              paragraphs, verse lines, or dramatic speeches. Typical examples include the canonical
              verses of the Bible, and the textual blocks of other ancient documents which predate
              the invention of the paragraph, such as Greek inscriptions or Egyptian hieroglyphs.
              The element is also useful as a means of encoding more specialized kinds of textual
              block, such as the question and answer structure of a catechism, or the highly
              formalized substructure of a legal document (if <gidiv/> is not considered
              appropriate for these). In more modern documents, it can be used to encode
              semi-organized or fragmentary materials such as an artist's notebook or work in
              progress; or to faithfully capture the substructure of a file produced by an OCR
              system. </p>

        <div xml:id="Simple-pln"
          ><headPage and Line Numbers/>
          <pPage and line breaks etc. may be marked with the following elements:><specList
              ><specDesc key="pb"/>
              <specDesc key="lb"/>
              <specDesc key="cb"/>
              <specDesc key="milestone"/>
              <specDesc key="fw"/>
            </specList> The <gipb/>, <gilb/>, and <gicb/> elements are special cases of
            a general class of elements known as <termmilestone/>s because they mark reference
            points within a text. The generic <gimilestone/> element can mark any kind of
            reference point: for example, a column break, the start of a new kind of section not
            otherwise tagged, a change of author or style, or in general any significant change in
            the text not enclosed by an XML element. Unlike other elements, milestone elements do
            not enclose a piece of text and make an assertion about it; instead they indicate a
            point in the text where something changes, as indicated by a change in the values of the
            milestone's attributes <attunit/>, which indicates the <qsomething/> concerned,
            and <attn/> which indicates the new value. </p>
          <pThe ><gipb/>, <gilb/>, and <gicb/> elements are shortcuts or <termsyntactic
              sugar/> for <tagmilestone unit="page"//>
            <tagmilestone unit="line"//> and <tagmilestone unit="column"//> respectively. </p>
          <pWhen working from a paginated original, it is often useful to record its pagination,
            whether to simplify later proof-reading, or to align the transcribed text with a set of
            page images, as further discussed below./>
          <pBecause ><gipb/> and other milestone elements are empty, they may be placed freely
            within or between other elements. However, it is recommended practice always to put them
            at the <emphbeginning/> of whatever unit it is that their presence implies, and
            not to nest them within elements contained by that unit. For example, in the following
            example a page break occurs between two lines of a poem: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
              ><lMary had a little lamb/>
              <pb n="13"/>
              <lIts fleece was white as snow/>
            </egXML> The <gipb/> element should be placed ahead of all the text encoded on the
            13th page. Contrast this with the following less accurate encoding: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
              ><lMary had a little lamb/>
              <l
                ><pb n="13"/>Its fleece was white as snow</l>
            </egXML> This is less accurate because it implies that the second verse line actually
            begins before the page break. </p>
          <pSimilar considerations apply to line breaks (><gilb/>), though these are less
            frequently considered useful when encoding modern printed textual sources. When
            transcribing manuscripts or early printed books, however, it is often helpful to retain
            them in an encoding, if only to facilitate alignment of transcription and original. Like
              <gipb/>, the <gilb/> element should appear <emphbefore/> the text of the
            line whose start it signals.</p>
          <pIf features such as pagination or lineation are marked for more than one edition, the
            edition in question may be specified by the ><atted/> attribute. For example, in the
            following passage we indicate where the page breaks occur in two different editions
              (<valED1/> and <valED2/>): <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                            ><pI wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had done:
                fully explaining also why I had thus acted. Diana and ><pb ed="ED1" n="475"/> Mary
                approved the step unreservedly. Diana announced that she would <pb ed="ED2" n="485"/>just give me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see
                me.</p>
                        </egXML>
          </p>
          <pWhen transcribing from a paginated source, the encoder must decide whether to suppress
            such features as running titles, page signatures, catch words etc., to replace them by a
            simplified representation using the ><gipb/> element, perhaps using the <attn/>
            attribute to preserve some of the information, or to preserve them entirely using the
              <gifw/> element. The latter strategy is appropriate in encodings which aim to
            retain as much information as possible about the original typography; it will however
            make more complex the processing of the source for other purposes, as in the following
            example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                            ><lHe also fix'd the wandering
                QUEEN OF NIGHT,/>
              <fw type="sig"Ii 2/>
              <fw type="catch"Whether/>
              <pb n="244"/>
              <lWhether she wanes into a scanty orb/>...<!-- Thomson, Seasons, 1730-->
            </egXML>
          </p>
          <pThe ><gipb/> element is also used to align parts of a transcription with a digital
            image of the page concerned. This may be done in a very simple but inflexible way by
            using the <attfacs/> attribute to point to each page image concerned: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                            ><pI wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge
                immediately, to say what I had done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted.
                Diana and ><pb ed="ED1" n="475" facs="ed1p475.png"/> Mary approved the step
                unreservedly... </p>
                        </egXML> The <attfacs/> attribute can supply (as here) a
            filename, or any other form of URI, if for example the page image is stored remotely.
            One drawback of this simplistic approach is that there must be exactly one image file
            per page of text. It is not therefore suitable in the case where the available page
            images represent double page spreads, or where there are multiple images of the same
            page (for example at different resolutions). </p>
          <pA more powerful approach, discussed in section ><ptr target="#Simple-fax"/> below, is to
            use the <gifacsimile/> element to define the organisation of the set of images
            representing the text, and then use the <attfacs/> attribute to point to individual
            components of that representation. </p>
        </div>
        <div xml:id="Simple-hilites"
          ><headMarking Highlighted Phrases/>
          <div xml:id="faces"
            ><headChanges of Typeface, etc./>
            <pHighlighted words or phrases are those made visibly different from the rest of the
              text, typically by a change of type font, handwriting style, ink colour etc., which is
              intended to draw the reader's attention to some associated change./>
            <pThe global ><attrendition/> attribute can be attached to any element, and used
              wherever necessary to specify details of the highlighting used for it in the source.
              For example, a heading rendered in bold might be tagged <taghead
                rendition="simple:bold"/>, and one in italic <taghead
                rendition="simple:italic"/>.</p>
            <pThe values used for the ><attrendition/> attribute point to definitions provided
              for the formatting concerned. These definitions are typically provided by a
                <girendition/> element in the document's header, as further discussed in section
                <ptr target="#hdr-rend"/>. </p>
            <pIt is not always possible or desirable to interpret the reasons for such changes of
              rendering in a text. In such cases, the element ><gihi/> may be used to mark a
              sequence of highlighted text without making any claim as to its status. <specList
                ><specDesc key="hi"/>
              </specList>
                        </p>
            <pIn the following example, the use of a distinct typeface for the subheading and for
              the included name are recorded but not interpreted: ><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                                ><p
                                    ><hi rendition="simple:blackletter"And
                    this Indenture further witnesseth/> that the said <hi rendition="simple:italic"Walter Shandy/>, merchant, in consideration of the

                            </egXML>
            </p>
            <pAlternatively, where the cause for the highlighting can be identified with
              confidence, a number of other, more specific, elements are available. ><specList
                ><!-- <specDesc key="emph"/>-->

            <pSome features (notably quotations, ><!--and glosses--> titles, and foreign words) may
              be found in a text either marked by highlighting, or with quotation marks. In either
              case, the element <giq/>
              <!--and
       <gi>gloss</gi>--> (as discussed in the following section) should be
              used. Again, the global <attrendition/> attribute can be used to record details
              of the highlighting used in the source if this is thought useful. </p>
            <pAs an example of the elements defined here, consider the following sentence: ><q rendition="simple:display"On the one hand the ><hi rendition="simple:italic"Nibelungenlied/> is associated with the new rise of romance of twelfth-century
                France, the <hi rendition="simple:italic"romans d'antiquité/>, the romances of
                Chrétien de Troyes, and the German adaptations of these works by Heinrich van
                Veldeke, Hartmann von Aue, and Wolfram von Eschenbach.</q> Interpreting the role of
              the highlighting, the sentence might be encoded as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                                ><pOn the one hand the
                    ><titleNibelungenlied/> is associated with the new rise of romance of
                  twelfth-century France, the <foreignromans d'antiquité/>, the romances of
                  Chrétien de Troyes, ...</p>
                            </egXML> Describing only the appearance of the
              original, it might be encoded like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                                ><pOn the one hand the ><hi rendition="simple:italic"Nibelungenlied/> is associated with the new rise of

            ><headQuotations and Related Features/>
            <pLike changes of typeface, quotation marks are conventionally used to denote several
              different features within a text, of which the most frequent is quotation, though many
              other features are possible. The full TEI Guidelines provide additional elements such
              as ><gimentioned/> or <gisaid/> to distinguish some of these features, but
              these more specialised elements are not included in TEI simplePrint. In TEI Simple however,
              we use the <giquote/> element for quotation only, and the <giq/> element for
              all other material found within quotation marks in the text.<specList
                ><specDesc key="q"/>
                <specDesc key="quote"/>
                <!--specDesc key="said"/-->
                <!--specDesc key="mentioned"/>-->
                <!--specDesc key="soCalled"/>-->
                <!--<specDesc key="gloss"/>-->
              </specList>
            </p>
            <pHere is a simple example of a quotation: ><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                                ><pFew dictionary makers are likely to
                  forget Dr. Johnson's description of the lexicographer as ><quotea harmless
                    drudge./>
                                </p>
                            </egXML>
            </p>
            <pAs elsewhere, the way that a citation or quotation was printed (for example,
                ><termin-line/> or set off as a <hidisplay/> or <hiblock quotation/>),
              may be represented using the <attrendition/> attribute. This may also be used to
              indicate the kind of quotation marks used.</p>
            <pDirect speech interrupted by a narrator can be represented simply by ending the
                ><giq/> element and beginning it again after the interruption, as in the
              following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                                ><p
                                    ><qWho-e debel
                    you?/> — he at last said — <qyou no speak-e, damme, I kill-e./> And so
                  saying, the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark.</p>
                            </egXML>
              If it is important to convey the idea that the two <giq/> elements together make
              up a single speech, the linking attributes <attnext/> and <attprev/> may be
              used, as described in section <ptr target="#xatts"/>.</p>
            <pDirect speech may be accompanied by a reference to the source or speaker, using the
                ><attwho/> attribute, whether or not this is explicit in the text, as in the
              following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                                ><q who="#Wilson"Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks with this very
                  paper in his hand, and he says:—><q who="#Spaulding"I wish to the Lord, Mr.
                    Wilson, that I was a red-headed man./>
                                </q>
                            </egXML> This example also
              demonstrates how quotations may be embedded within other quotations: one speaker
              (Wilson) quotes another speaker (Spaulding).</p>
            <pThe creator of the electronic text must decide whether quotation marks are replaced
              by the tags or whether the tags are added and the quotation marks kept. If the
              quotation marks are removed from the text, the ><attrendition/> attribute may be
              used to record the way in which they were rendered in the copy text.</p>
            <!-- example please -->
          </div>
          <div xml:id="z636"
            ><headForeign Words or Expressions/>
            <pWords, phrases, or longer stretches of text that are not in the main language of the
              texts may be tagged as such in one of two ways. The global ><attxml:lang/>
              attribute may be attached to any element to show that it uses some other language than
              that of the surrounding text. Where there is no applicable element, the element
                <giforeign/> may be used, again using the <attxml:lang/> attribute. For
              example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                                ><pJohn has real ><foreign xml:lang="fr"savoir-faire/>.</p>
                                <pHave you read ><title xml:lang="de"Die Dreigroschenoper/>?</p>
                            </egXML>
            </p>
            <pAs these examples show, the ><giforeign/> element should not be used to tag
              foreign words if some other more specific element such as <gititle/>, or
                <gidiv/> applies. </p>
            <pThe value of the ><attxml:lang/> attribute on an element applies hierarchically
              to everything contained by that element, unless overridden:</p>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
              ><div xml:lang="la"
                ><pPars haec Latine composita est./>
                <p xml:lang="en"Except that this sentence is in English./>
                <pVita brevis, ars longa./>
              </div>
            </egXML>
            <pHere we specify that the whole ><gidiv/> element uses the language with the coded
              identifier <valla/> i.e., Latin. Since it is contained by that <gidiv/> there
              is no need to supply this information again for the first <gis/> element. The
              second <gis/> element however overrides this value, and indicates that its content
              is in English (the language with identifier <valen/>). The third <gis/>
              element is again in Latin.</p>
            <pThe codes used to identify languages, supplied on the ><attxml:lang/> attribute,
              are defined by an international standard<note place="foot"The relevant Internet
                standard is ><titleBest Current Practice 47/> (<ptr target="http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47"/>). The authoritative list of registered

        <div xml:id="Simple-notes"
          ><headNotes/>
          <pA note is any additional comment found in a text, marked in some way as being out of
            the main textual stream. A note is always attached to some part of the text, implicitly
            or explicitly: we call this its target, or its ><termpoint of attachment/>. The
            element <ginote/> should be used to mark any kind of note whether it appears as a
            separate block of text in the main text area, at the foot of the page, at the end of the
            chapter or volume, in the margin, or in some other place. <specList
              ><specDesc key="note"/>
            </specList>
          </p>
          <pNotes may be in a different hand or typeface, may be authorial or editorial, and may
            have been added later. The attributes ><atttype/> and <attresp/> can be used to
            distinguish between different kinds of notes or identify their authors.</p>
          <pIn a printed or written text, the point of attachment for a note is typically
            represented by a siglum such as an alphanumerical or other character, often in
            superscripted form. When encoding such a text, it is conventional to replace this siglum
            by a note element containing the annotation itself, as in the following example: ><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
              ><p...some text ><note xml:id="n7"a note about some text/> .... </p>
            </egXML>
          </p>
          <pAn alternative approach is to encode the point of attachment wherever it appears in the
            text, using for example the ><giref/> element discussed in the next section, and to
            place the <ginote/> element anywhere convenient. The two can then be associated by
            using the <atttarget/> attribute on the <giref/> element to point to the
              <ginote/> element, as in the following example, in which the superscripted
              <q7/> indicating the point of attachment has been retained as part of the encoding:
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
              ><p...some text ><ref target="#n7" rendition="simple:superscript"7/> .... <note xml:id="n7"a note about some text/>
                            </p>
            </egXML>
          </p>
          <pIt may however be problematic to determine the precise position of the point of
            attachment, particularly in the case of marginal notes. A marginal note may also be hard
            to distinguish from a label or subheading which introduces the text with which it is
            associated. Where the purpose of the note is clearly to label the associated text,
            rather than to comment on it, the element ><gilabel/> may be preferable. Where it is
            clearly a subheading attached to a distinct subdivision, it may be preferable to start a
            new element <gidiv/> and encode the subheading as a <gihead/>. Note however that
            a <gihead/> cannot be inserted anywhere except at the beginning of a <gidiv/>.
            And where (as in some Early Modern English plays) marginal annotation is systematically
            used to identify speakers, it may be better to represent these using the
              <gispeaker/> element introduced above. In cases of doubt, the encoder should
            decide on a clear policy and preferably document it for the use of others. </p>
        </div>
        <div xml:id="Simple-ptrs"
          ><headCross References and Links/>
          <pAny kind of cross reference or link found at one point in a text which points to
            another part of the same or another document may be encoded using the ><giref/>
            element discussed in this section. Implicit links (such as the association between two
            parallel texts, or that between a text and its interpretation) may be encoded using the
            linking attributes discussed in section <ptr target="#xatts"/>.</p>
          <div xml:id="ptrs"
            ><headSimple Cross References/>
            <p
                            ><specList
                ><specDesc key="ref"/>
              </specList>
            </p>
            <pUsually, the presence of a cross-reference or link will be indicated by some text or
              symbol in the source being encoded, which will then become the content of the
                ><giref/> element. Occasionally, however, and frequently in the case of a born
              digital document, the exact form and appearance of the cross reference text will be
              determined dynamically by the software processing the document. In such cases, the
                <giref/> element will have no content, and serve simply to mark a point from
              which a link is to be made, along with the target of the link. </p>
            <pThe following two forms, for example, are logically equivalent: ><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"See especially ><ref target="#SEC12"section
                  12 on page 34/>.</egXML>
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"See especially ><ref target="#SEC12"/>.</egXML> In both cases, there is a cross reference from the position in the
              source document immediately following the word <mentionedespecially/> to
              whatever element in the encoded document has the identifier <valSEC12/>. In the
              first case, the encoder has supplied the original form of the cross reference
                <soCalledsection 12 on page 34/>; in the second, the task of generating an
              appropriate form of cross reference has been left to the formatting software. Perhaps
              the pagination and section numbers of the document in question are not yet determined;
              perhaps the cross reference should be replaced by a big red button. In either case,
              however, the value of the <atttarget/> attribute must be the identifier of some
              other element within the current document. Since the passage or phrase being pointed
              at must bear an identifier, it must be an element of some kind. In the following
              example, the cross reference is to a <gidiv/> element: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" ... see especially ><ref target="#SEC12"/>.
                ... <div xml:id="SEC12"
                  ><headConcerning Identifiers/>
                  <!-- ... -->
                </div>
                            </egXML>
            </p>
            <pBecause the ><attxml:id/> attribute is global, any element in a TEI document may
              be pointed to in this way. In the following example, a paragraph has been given an
              identifier so that it may be pointed at: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" ... this is discussed in ><ref target="#pspec"the paragraph on links/> ... <p xml:id="pspec"Links may be
                  made to any kind of element .../>
                            </egXML>
            </p>
            <pSometimes the target of a cross reference does not correspond with any particular
              feature of a text, and so may not be tagged as an element of some kind. If the desired
              target is simply a point in the current document, the easiest way to mark it is by
              introducing an ><gianchor/> element at the appropriate spot. If the target is some
              sequence of words not otherwise tagged, the <giseg/> element may be used to mark
              them. These two elements are described as follows: <specList
                ><specDesc key="anchor"/>
                <specDesc key="seg"/>
              </specList>
            </p>
            <pIn the following example, ><giref/> elements have been used to represent points in
              this text which are to be linked in some way to other parts of it; in the first case
              to a point, and in the second, to a sequence of words: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" Returning to ><ref target="#ABCD"the point
                  where I dozed off/>, I noticed that <ref target="#EFGH"three words/> had
                been circled in red by a previous reader</egXML>
            </p>
            <pThis encoding requires that elements with the specified identifiers (><valABCD/>
              and <valEFGH/> in this example) are to be found somewhere else in the current
              document. Assuming that no element already exists to carry these identifiers, the
                <gianchor/> and <giseg/> elements may be used: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" .... ><anchor type="bookmark" xml:id="ABCD"/> .... ....<seg type="target" xml:id="EFGH" ... /> ...</egXML>
            </p>
            <pThe ><atttype/> attribute should be used (as above) to distinguish amongst
              different purposes for which these general purpose elements might be used in a text.
              Some other uses are discussed in section <ptr target="#xatts"/> below.</p>
          </div>
          <div xml:id="xptrs"
            ><headPointing to other documents/>
            <pSo far, we have shown how the ><giref/> element may be used for cross-references
              or links whose targets occur within the same document as their source. The element may
              also be used to refer to elements in any other XML document or resource, such as a
              document on the web, or a database component. This is possible because the value of
              the <atttarget/> attribute may be any valid <termUniform Resource
                Identifier/> (URI)<note place="foot"A full definition of this term, defined by
                the W3C (the consortium which manages the development and maintenance of the World
                Wide Web), is beyond the scope of this tutorial: however, the most frequently
                encountered version of a URI is the familiar URL used to indicate a web page, such
                as ><codehttp://www.tei-c.org/index.xml/>
                            </note>. </p>
            <pA URI may reference a web page or just a part of one, for example
                ><codehttp://www.tei-c.org/index.xml#SEC2/>. The hash sign indicates that what
              follows it is the identifier of an element to be located within the XML document
              identified by what precedes it: this example will therefore locate an element which
              has an <attxml:id/> attribute value of <valSEC2/> within the document
              retrieved from <codehttp://www.tei-c.org/index.xml/>. In the examples we have
              discussed so far, the part to the left of the sharp sign has been omitted: this is
              understood to mean that the referenced element is to be located within the current
              document.</p>
            <pIt is also possible to define an abbreviated form of the URI, using a predefined
                ><termprefix/> separated from the rest of the code by a colon, as for example
                <valcesr:SEC2/>. This is known as a <termprivate URI/>, since the prefix
              is not standardized (except that the prefix <valxml:/> is reserved for use by XML
              itself). A <giprefixDef/> element should be supplied within the TEI header
              specifying how the prefix (here <valcesr/>) should be translated to give a full
              URL for the link. This is particularly useful if a document contains many references
              to an external document such as an authority file. </p>
            <pParts of an XML document can be specified by means of other more sophisticated
              mechanisms using a language called Xpointer, also defined by the W3C. This is useful
              when, for example, the elements to be linked to do not bear identifiers. Further
              information about this and other forms of link addressing is provided in ><ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SA.html"chapter 16 of
                the TEI Guidelines/> but is beyond the scope of the present document.</p>

          <div xml:id="xatts"
            ><headSpecial Kinds of Linking/>
            <pThe following special purpose ><termlinking/> attributes are defined for every
              element in the TEI simplePrint schema: <list type="gloss"
                ><label
                                    ><attana/>
                                </label>
                <itemlinks an element with its interpretation./>
                <label
                                    ><attcorresp/>
                                </label>
                <itemlinks an element with one or more other corresponding elements./>
                <label
                                    ><attnext/>
                                </label>
                <itemlinks an element to the next element in an aggregate./>
                <label
                                    ><attprev/>
                                </label>
                <itemlinks an element to the previous element in an aggregate./>
              </list>
                        </p>
            <pThe ><attana/> (analysis) attribute is intended for use where a set of abstract
              analyses or interpretations have been defined somewhere within a document, as further
              discussed in section <ptr target="#Simple-anal"/>. For example, a linguistic analysis
              of the sentence <qJohn loves Nancy/> might be encoded as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                                ><seg type="sentence" ana="#SVO"
                  ><seg type="lex" ana="#NP1"John/>
                  <seg type="lex" ana="#VVI"loves/>
                  <seg type="lex" ana="#NP1"Nancy/>
                </seg>
                            </egXML> This encoding implies the existence elsewhere in the document of
              elements with identifiers <valSVO/>, <valNP1/>, and <valVV1/> where the
              significance of these particular codes is explained. Note the use of the <giseg/>
              element to mark particular components of the analysis, distinguished by the
                <atttype/> attribute.</p>
            <pThe ><attcorresp/> (corresponding) attribute provides a simple way of
              representing some form of correspondence between two elements in a text. For example,
              in a multilingual text, it may be used to link translation equivalents, as in the
              following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                ><seg xml:lang="fr" xml:id="FR1" corresp="#EN1"Jean aime Nancy/>
                <seg xml:lang="en" xml:id="EN1" corresp="#FR1"John loves Nancy/>
                            </egXML>
            </p>
            <pThe same mechanism may be used for a variety of purposes. In the following example,
              it has been used to represent the correspondences between ><qthe show/> and
                <qShirley/>, and between <qNBC/> and <qthe network/>: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                                ><p
                                    ><title xml:id="shirley"Shirley/>,
                  which made its Friday night debut only a month ago, was not listed on <name xml:id="nbc"NBC/>'s new schedule, although <seg xml:id="network" corresp="#nbc"the network/> says <seg xml:id="show" corresp="#shirley"the
                    show/> still is being considered.</p>
                            </egXML>
            </p>
            <pThe ><attnext/> and <attprev/> attributes provide a simple way of linking
              together the components of a discontinuous element, as in the following example:
                <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                                ><q xml:id="Q1a" next="#Q1b"Who-e
                  debel you?/> — he at last said — <q xml:id="Q1b" prev="#Q1a"you no speak-e,
                  damme, I kill-e./> And so saying, the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about
                me in the dark.</egXML>
            </p>

      </div>
      <div xml:id="Simple-edit1"
        ><headEditorial Interventions/>
        <pThe process of encoding an electronic text has much in common with the process of editing
          a manuscript or other text for printed publication. In either case a conscientious editor
          may wish to record both the original state of the source and any editorial correction or
          other change made in it. The elements discussed in this and the next section provide some
          facilities for meeting these needs./>
        <div
          ><headCorrection and Normalization/>
          <pThe following elements may be used to mark ><termcorrections/>, that is editorial
            changes introduced where the editor believes the original to be erroneous: <specList
              ><specDesc key="corr"/>
              <specDesc key="sic"/>
            </specList>
          </p>
          <pThe following elements may be used to mark ><termnormalization/>, that is
            editorial changes introduced for the sake of consistency or modernization of a text: <specList
              ><specDesc key="orig"/>
              <specDesc key="reg"/>
            </specList>
                    </p>
          <pConsider, for example, the following famous passage as it appears in the first quarto
            printing of Shakespeare's ><titleHenry V/>: <figure
              ><graphic url="../Images/tableofgreenfields.png" width="400px" height="100px"/>
              <head type="legend"Detail from ><titleHenry V/>, first quarto (1600)</head>
            </figure> in particular the phrase we might transcribe directly as <eg ... for his Nose
              was as sharpe as a Pen, and a Table of greene fields/>
          </p>
          <pA modern editor might wish to make a number of interventions here, specifically to
            modernize (or normalize) the Elizabethan spellings of ><mentioneda'/> and
              <mentionedsharpe/> for <mentionedhe/> and
              <mentionedsharp/> respectively. They might also want to emend
              <mentionedtable/> to <mentionedbabbl'd/>, following an editorial
            tradition that goes back to the 18th century Shakespearian scholar Lewis Theobald. The
            following encoding would then be appropriate: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"... for his Nose was as ><regsharp/> as a
              Pen and <reghe/>
              <corr resp="#Theobald"babbl'd/> of green fields</egXML>
          </p>
          <pA more conservative or source-oriented editor, however, might want to retain the
            original, but at the same time signal that some of the readings it contains are in some
            sense anomalous: ><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"... for his Nose was as
                ><origsharpe/> as a Pen, and <origa/>
              <sicTable/> of green fields</egXML>
          </p>
          <pFinally, a modern digital editor may decide to combine both possibilities in a single
            composite text, using the ><gichoice/> element. <specList
              ><specDesc key="choice"/>
            </specList> This allows an editor to indicate where alternative encodings are possible:
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"... for his Nose was as ><choice
                ><origsharpe/>
                <regsharp/>
              </choice> as a Pen, and <choice
                ><origa/>
                <reghe/>
              </choice>
              <choice
                ><corr resp="#Theobald"babbl'd/>
                <sicTable/>
              </choice> of green fields </egXML>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div xml:id="Simple-edit2"
          ><headOmissions, Deletions, and Additions/>
          <pIn addition to correcting or normalizing words and phrases, editors and transcribers
            may also supply missing material, omit material, or transcribe material deleted or
            crossed out in the source. In addition, some material may be particularly hard to
            transcribe because it is hard to make out on the page. The following elements may be
            used to record such phenomena: ><specList
              ><specDesc key="add"/>
              <specDesc key="gap"/>
              <specDesc key="del"/>
              <specDesc key="unclear"/>
              <specDesc key="supplied"/>
              <specDesc key="subst"/>
            </specList>
          </p>
          <pThese elements may be used to record changes made by an editor, by the transcriber, or
            (in manuscript material) by the author or scribe. For example, if the source for an
            electronic text read ><qThe following elements are provided for for simple editorial
              interventions./> then it might be felt desirable to correct the obvious error, but
            at the same time to record the deletion of the superfluous second
              <mentionedfor/>, thus: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"The
              following elements are provided for ><del resp="#LB"for/> simple editorial
              interventions.</egXML> The attribute value <val#LB/> on the <attresp/>
            attribute is used to point to a fuller definition (typically in a <girespStmt/>
            element) of the person or other agency responsible for correcting the duplication of
              <mentionedfor/>.</p>
          <pIf the source read ><qThe following elements provided for simple editorial
              interventions./> (i.e. if the word <mentionedare/> had been inadvertently
            dropped) then the scholar identified as <valLB/> might choose to encode the
            corrected text as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"The following
              elements ><add resp="#LB"are/> provided for simple editorial
              interventions.</egXML>
          </p>
          <pThese elements may also be used to record the actual writing process, for example to
            record passages which have been deleted, added, corrected etc., whether by the author of
            a literary text or by a scribe copying out a manuscript. An analysis of such documentary
            modifications may be essential before a reading text can be presented, and is clearly of
            importance in the editorial process. />
          <pThe example is taken from the surviving authorial manuscript of a poem by the English
            writer Wilfred Owen, a part of which is shown here: />
          <figure
            ><graphic url="../Images/PHowen.png" width="400px" height="100px"/>
            <head type="legend"Detail from ><titleDulce et decorum est/> autograph manuscript
              in the English Faculty Library, Oxford University. </head>
          </figure>
          <pOwen first wrote ><qHelping the worst amongst us/>, but then deleted it, adding
              <qDragging the worst amongt us/> over the top. In the same way, he revised the
            phrase <qhalf–blind/> by deleting the <qhalf–/> and adding
              <qall/> above it. In the last line, he started a word beginning <qfif/> before
            deleting it and writing the word <qfive–nines/>. We can encode all of this as
            follows: </p>
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
            ><lAnd towards our distant rest began to trudge,/>
            <l
                            ><subst
                ><delHelping the worst amongst us/>
                <addDragging the worst amongt us/>
              </subst>, who’d no boots </l>
            <lBut limped on, blood–shod. All went lame; ><subst
                ><del status="shortEnd"half–/>
                <addall/>
              </subst> blind;</l>
            <lDrunk with fatigue ; deaf even to the hoots/>
            <lOf tired, outstripped ><delfif/> five–nines that dropped behind.</l>
          </egXML>
          <pThe tags ><giadd/> and <gidel/> elements are used to enclose passages added or
            deleted respectively. Additional attributes are available such as <attresp/> to
            indicate responsibility for the modification, or <attplace/> to indicate where in
            the text (for example, above or below the line) the modification has been made. Where
            the encoder wishes to assert that the addition and deletion make up a single editorial
            act of substitution, these elements can be combined within a <gisubst/> element as
            shown above.</p>
          <pA very careful examination of Owen’s second modification shows that he really
            did write ><qamongt/> rather than <qamongst/>, presumably in error. An equally
            careful editor wishing to restore the missing <qs/> might use the <gisupplied/>
            element to indicate that they have done so:</p>
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
            ><addDragging the worst among><supplied resp="#ED"s/>t us</add>
          </egXML>
          <pHere the ><attresp/> attribute has been used to indicate that the <qs/> was not
            supplied by Owen but by someone else, specifically the person documented elsewhere by an
            element with the identifier <valED/>. </p>
          <pThe ><giunclear/> element is useful where material in the source is so hard to read
            that the transcriber is uncertain as to whether they have done so correctly. It The
              <gigap/> element by contrast should be used where the material is so illegible
            that the transcriber does not wish even to attempt it. The two may however be used
            together as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"One hundred & twenty good regulars joined ><unclearto me ><gap extent="2 words" reason="indecipherable"/> and </unclear> instantly, would aid me signally in an
              enterprise against Wilmington.</egXML>
          </p>
          <pThe ><gidel/> element marks material which is deleted in a source, but has been
            transcribed as part of the electronic text all the same, while <gigap/> marks the
            location of source material which is omitted from the electronic text, whether it is
            legible or not. A language corpus, for example, might omit long quotations in foreign
            languages. An <attextent/> attribute is available on the <gigap/> element to
            indicate how much material has been omitted. The <gidesc/> element can be used
            inside the <gigap/> element to provide a brief characterisation of the omitted
            material, as in the following examples: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                            ><p ... An example of a list appearing in a fief ledger of ><name type="place"Koldinghus/>

                ><descquotation from ledger (in Danish)/>
              </gap>

              />
                        </egXML> (The <giname/> and <gidate/> elements used in this example are
            discussed further below)</p>
          <pLanguage corpora (particular those constructed before the widespread use of scanners)

              <specDesc key="expan"/>
            </specList>
          </p>
          <pThe ><giabbr/> element is useful as a means of distinguishing semi-lexical items
            such as acronyms or jargon: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"Every
              manufacturer of ><abbr3GL/> or <abbr4GL/> languages is currently nailing on
                <abbrOOP/> extensions</egXML>
          </p>
          <pThe ><atttype/> attribute may be used to distinguish types of abbreviation by their
            function. </p>
          <pThe ><giexpan/> element is used to mark an expansion supplied by an encoder. This
            element is particularly useful in the transcription of manuscript materials. For
            example, the character p with a bar through its descender as a conventional
            representation for the word <valper/> is commonly encountered in Medieval European
            manuscripts. An encoder may choose to expand this as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                            ><expanper/>
                        </egXML>
          </p>
          <pTo record both an abbreviation and its expansion, the ><gichoice/> element mentioned
            above may be used to group the abbreviated form with its proposed expansion: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
              ><choice
                ><abbrwt/>
                <expanwith/>
              </choice>
            </egXML>
          </p>
          <pThe elements ><giexpan/> and <giabbr/> should contain a full word, or the
            abbreviated form of a full word respectively. <!--If it is required to tag smaller
            components of an abbreviated word, the following elements are also available in TEI
            Simple: <specList>
              <specDesc key="am"/>
              <specDesc key="ex"/>
            </specList>--> For a fuller discussion of abbreviations and the intricacies of representing
            them consult the section on <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/PH.html#PHAB"Abbreviation
              and Expansion/> in the TEI Guidelines. </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div xml:id="Simple-names"
        ><headNames, Codes, and Numbers/>
        <pThe TEI scheme defines elements for a large number of ><soCalleddata-like/>
          features which may appear almost anywhere within almost any kind of text. These features
          may be of particular interest in a range of disciplines; they all relate to objects
          external to the text itself, such as the names of persons and places, strings of code,
          formulae, or numbers and dates. These items may also pose particular problems for natural
          language processing (NLP) applications. The elements described here, by making such
          features explicit, reduce the complexity of processing texts containing them.</p>
        <div xml:id="nomen"
          ><headNames and Referring Strings/>
          <pA ><termreferring string/> is any phrase which refers to some person, place,
            object, etc. A <termname/> is a referring string which contains proper nouns and
            honorifics only. Two elements are provided to mark such strings: <specList
              ><specDesc key="rs"/>
              <specDesc key="name"/>
            </specList>
          </p>
          <pThe ><atttype/> attribute is used to distinguish amongst (for example) names of
            persons, places and organizations, where this is possible: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                            ><qMy dear ><name type="person"Mr.
                  Bennet/>, </q>said his lady to him one day, <qhave you heard that ><name type="place"Netherfield Park/> is let at last?</q>
                        </egXML>
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"It being one of the principles of the
                ><name type="organization"Circumlocution Office/> never, on any account
              whatsoever, to give a straightforward answer, <name type="person"Mr Barnacle/>
              said, <qPossibly./>
                        </egXML>
          </p>
          <pAs the following example shows, the ><girs/> element may be used for a reference to
            a person, place, etc., which does not contain a proper noun or noun phrase: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                            ><qMy dear ><name type="person"Mr.
                  Bennet/>,</q> said <rs type="person"his lady/> to him one day...</egXML>
          </p>
          <pSimply tagging something as a name is rarely enough to enable automatic processing of
            personal names into the canonical forms usually required for reference purposes. The
            name as it appears in the text may be inconsistently spelled, partial, or vague.
            Moreover, name prefixes such as ><mentionedvan/> or <mentionedde
              la/>, may or may not be included as part of the reference form of a name,
            depending on the language and country of origin of the bearer.</p>
          <pThe ><attref/> attribute provides a way of linking a name with a description of the
            object being named, and may thus act as a normalized identifier for it. It is also very
            useful as a means of gathering together all references to the same individual or
            location scattered throughout a document: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                            ><qMy dear ><name type="person" ref="#BENM1"Mr. Bennet/>, </q> said <rs type="person" ref="#BENM2"his lady/> to him
              one day, <qhave you heard that ><name type="place" ref="#NETP1"Netherfield
                  Park/> is let at last?</q>
                        </egXML>
          </p>
          <pThe values used for the ><attref/> attribute here (<val#BENM1/> etc.) are
            pointers; in this case indicating an element with the identifier <valBENM1/> etc.
            somewhere in the current document, though any form of URI could be used. The element
            indicated will typically (for a person) be a <giperson/> element, listed within a
              <giparticDesc/> element, or (for a place) a <giplace/> element, listed within
            a <gisettingDesc/> element in the TEI header, as further discussed in <ptr target="#profDesc"/> below.</p>
          <pThis use should be distinguished from the case of the ><gireg/> (regularization)
            element, which provides a means of marking the standard form of a referencing string as
            demonstrated below: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                            ><name type="person" ref="#WADLM1"
                                ><choice
                  ><origWalter de la Mare/>
                  <regde la Mare, Walter/>
                </choice>
                            </name> was born at <name key="Ch1" type="place"Charlton/>, in <name key="KT1" type="county"Kent/>, in 1873.</egXML>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div xml:id="code"
          ><headFormulae, Codes, and Special Characters/>
          <pThe following elements may be useful when marking up sequences of text that represent
            mathematical expressions, chemical formulae, and the like: ><specList
              ><specDesc key="formula"/>
              <specDesc key="g"/>
            </specList>
          </p>
          <pIn many cases, a simple Unicode character suffices to represent the superscript or
            subscript digits and other symbols which may appear inside a mathematical formula:
              ><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                            ><formulaE=mc²/>
                        </egXML> In
            other more complex cases, the encoder may choose to use a different XML scheme (such as
            MathML) to encode the content of a formula, or a non-XML notation. These possibilities
            are not discussed further here. </p>
          <pThe ><gig/> element is useful in the case that no Unicode character exists to
            represent the character or glyph required. Its <attref/> attribute can be used to
            point to a definition of the symbol intended, while its content (if any) represents a
            Unicode approximation to it: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"...Thereto
                ><g ref="#air"[air]/> and ... </egXML> The TEI header provides a number of
            additional elements for the definition of such non-Unicode characters, as further
            discussed in section <ptr target="#chardecl"/> below. </p>
          <pThe following elements are useful for stretches of code or similar formal language
            appearing within a text: ><specList
              ><specDesc key="code"/>
              <specDesc key="email"/>
            </specList>
          </p>
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" This can be expressed in XML as follows:
              ><code&lt;date notBefore="2016-06-23"/>/> Contact the author at
              <emaillou.burnard@gmail.com/>
          </egXML>
          <pNote in this example that characters which have a syntactic function in XML (such as
            the ampersand or the angle bracket) must be represented within a TEI simplePrint document by
            means of an entity reference such as ><code&lt;/> or <code&amp;/>. </p>
          <pThe element ><giref/> discussed in section <ptr target="#Simple-ptrs"/> should be
            used to represent a coded reference such as a link given as a URL within a text, either
            as content or as an attribute value: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
              ><pFurther discussion of ><ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/"the Text Encoding

        </div>
        <div
          ><headDates and Times/>
          <pThe following elements are provided for the detailed encoding of times and dates: ><specList
              ><specDesc key="date"/>
              <specDesc key="time"/>
            </specList>
          </p>
          <pThese elements have a number of attributes which can be used to provide normalized
            versions of their values in various ways. ><specList
              ><specDesc key="att.datable" atts="period when notBefore notAfter"/>
            </specList> The <attwhen/> attribute specifies a normalized form for the date or
            time, using one of the standard formats defined by ISO 8601. Partial dates or times
            (e.g. <q1990/>, <qSeptember 1990/>, <qtwelvish/>) can be expressed by omitting
            a part of the value supplied, as in the following examples: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                            ><date when="1980-02-21"21 Feb
                1980/>
                            <date when="1990"1990/>
                            <date when="1990-09"September
                1990/>
                            <date when="--09"September/>
                            <date when="2001-09-11T12:48:00"Sept
                11th, 12 minutes before 9 am/>
                        </egXML>
            <!--Note in the last example the use of a
            normalized representation for the date string which includes a time: this example could
            thus equally well be tagged using the <gi>time</gi> element.-->
          </p>
          <pThese attributes are typically used to make a date or time more easily processable, as
            in the following examples: ><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"Given on the
                ><date when="1977-06-12"Twelfth Day of June in the Year of Our Lord One Thousand

                            </l>
            </egXML> They are also useful in cases where the date concerned is uncertain or only
            vaguely specified: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
              ><p... ><date period="secondEmpire"during the second empire/>
                            </p>

        </div>
        <div
          ><headNumbers and Measurements/>
          <pLike dates, both numbers and quantities can be written with either letters or digits
            and may therefore need to be normalized for ease of processing. Their presentation is
            also highly language-dependent (e.g. English ><mentioned5th/> becomes Greek
              <mentioned5./>; English <mentioned123,456.78/> equals French
              <mentioned123.456,78/>). </p>
          <pThe following elements are provided for the detailed encoding of numbers and
            quantities: ><specList
              ><specDesc key="num" atts="type value"/>
              <specDesc key="measure" atts="quantity unit commodity"/>
            </specList>
          </p>
          <pFor example: ><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"

        </div>
      </div>
      <div xml:id="Simple-lists"
        ><headLists/>
        <pThe element ><gilist/> is used to mark any kind of <termlist/>. A list is a
          sequence of text items, which may be numbered, bulleted, or arranged as a glossary list.
          Each item may be preceded by an item label (in a glossary list, this label is the term
          being defined): <specList
            ><specDesc key="list"/>
            <specDesc key="item"/>
            <specDesc key="label"/>
          </specList>
        </p>
        <pIndividual list items are tagged with ><giitem/>. The first <giitem/> may
          optionally be preceded by a <gihead/>, which gives a heading for the list. The
          numbering of items within the list may be omitted, indicated using the <attn/>
          attribute on each item, or (rarely) tagged as content using the <gilabel/> element.
          The following are all thus equivalent: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                        ><list

        <pA simple two-column table may be treated as a ><termglossary list/>, tagged

        <pLists of bibliographic items should be tagged using the ><gilistBibl/> element,
          described in the next section.</p>
      </div>
      <div xml:id="Simple-bibls"
        ><headBibliographic Citations/>
        <pIt is often useful to distinguish bibliographic citations where they occur within texts
          being transcribed for research, if only so that they will be properly formatted when the
          text is printed out. The element ><gibibl/> is provided for this purpose. Where the
          components of a bibliographic reference are to be distinguished, the following elements
          may be used as appropriate. It is generally useful to distinguish at least those parts
          (such as the titles of articles, books, and journals) which will need special formatting.
          The other elements are provided for cases where particular interest attaches to such
          details: <specList
            ><specDesc key="bibl"/>
            <specDesc key="author"/>
            <specDesc key="biblScope"/>
            <specDesc key="date"/>
            <specDesc key="editor"/>
            <specDesc key="publisher"/>
            <specDesc key="pubPlace"/>
            <specDesc key="relatedItem"/>
            <specDesc key="title"/>
          </specList>
                </p>
        <pConsider, for example the following editorial note: ><q rend="display"He was a member of
            Parliament for Warwickshire in 1445, and died March 14, 1470 (according to Kittredge,
              ><titleHarvard Studies/> 5. 88ff).</q> This might be encoded as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"He was a member of Parliament for Warwickshire
            in 1445, and died March 14, 1470 (according to ><bibl

                <titleHarvard Studies/> 5. 88ff</bibl>).</egXML>
        </p>
        <pThe bibliographic elements listed above are particularly useful in a born digital
          document which contains a bibliography encoded using the ><gilistBibl/> element.
          Entries in the bibliography should be given an identifier, which can then be used as the
          target of cross references from elsewhere in the document: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
            ><pPerec citing, amongst others ><ref target="#MK_73"Sturm und Drang, 1973/>,
              concludes ... </p>
          </egXML>
        </p>
        <p A ><gibibl/> element may contain simply text, with possibly a few of its components
          distinguished by tagging, and much use of conventionalized punctuation, as in this
          example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
            ><bibl xml:id="MK_73"Sturm, U. & Drang, F. : ><titleMusikalische
              Katastrophe/>. (Berlin, W. de Gruyter, 1973)</bibl>
          </egXML> Alternatively, each of the components of the bibliographic reference may be
          clearly distinguished by tagging; in this case there is no requirement for
          conventionalized punctuation, since the processor will be able to generate this
          appropriately: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
            ><bibl xml:id="MK73"
                            ><authorSturm, U./>
              <authorDrang, F./>
              <title xml:lang="de" level="m"Musikalische Katastrophe/>
              <pubPlaceBerlin/>

                        </bibl>
          </egXML>
        </p>
        <pThe element ><gibiblFull/> is also provided for convience in cases where bibliographic
          citations following a more sophisticated model have been used; it is permitted only in the
          TEI header. <!--A third bibliographic element
          <gi>biblStruct</gi>, is provided only by the full TEI Guidelines. -->
          <specList
            ><specDesc key="biblFull"/>

        -->
            <specDesc key="listBibl"/>
          </specList>
        </p>
        <pThe ><gilistBibl/> element is used to group lists of bibliographic citations. It may
          contain a series of <gibibl/><!--, <gi>biblStruct</gi>,--> or <gibiblFull/>

      </div>
      <div xml:id="Simple-tables"
        ><headTables/>
        <pThe following elements are provided for the description of tabular matter, commonly found

        <pThe ><attrole/> attribute may be used on either <gicell/> or <girow/>to
          indicate the function of a cell, or of a row of cells. Its values should be taken from the

                        <pThis shutting up of houses was at first counted a very cruel and
              unchristian method, and the poor people so confined made bitter lamentations. ...
            />

        </p>
      </div>
      <div xml:id="Simple-figs"
        ><headFigures and Graphics/>
        <pNot all the components of a document are necessarily textual. The most straightforward
          text will often contain diagrams or illustrations, to say nothing of documents in which
          image and text are inextricably intertwined, or electronic resources in which the two are
          complementary. />
        <pThe encoder may simply record the presence of a graphic within the text, possibly with a
          brief description of its content, and may also provide a link to a digitized version of
          the graphic, using the following elements: ><specList
            ><specDesc key="graphic"/>
            <specDesc key="figure"/>
            <specDesc key="figDesc"/>
          </specList>
                </p>
        <pAny textual information accompanying the graphic, such as a heading and/or caption, may
          be included within the ><gifigure/> element itself, in a <gihead/> and one or more
            <gip/> elements, as may any text appearing within the graphic itself. It is strongly
          recommended that a prose description of the image be supplied, as the content of a
            <gifigDesc/> element, for the use of applications which are not able to render the
          graphic, and to render the document accessible to vision-impaired readers. (Such text is
          not normally considered part of the document proper.)</p>
        <pThe simplest use for these elements is to mark the position of a graphic and provide a
          link to it, as in this example: ><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
            ><pb n="412"/>
                        <figure
              ><graphic url="images/p412fig.png"/>
            </figure>
            <pb n="413"/>
                    </egXML> This indicates that the graphic contained by the file
            <identp412fig.png/> appears between pages 412 and 413. </p>
        <pThe ><gigraphic/> element can appear anywhere that textual content is permitted,
          within but not between paragraphs or headings. In the following example, the encoder has
          decided to treat a specific printer's ornament as a heading: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                        ><head
                            ><graphic url="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/gants/Ornaments/Heads/hp-ral02.gif"/>
                        </head>
                    </egXML>
        </p>
        <pMore usually, a graphic will have at the least an identifying title, which may be encoded
          using the ><gihead/> element, or a number of figures may be grouped together in a
          particular structure, as in the following example: <figure
            ><graphic url="../Images/fezziPic.png"/>
            <head
                            ><titleMr Fezziwig's Ball/>: illustration by George Cruikshank from Dickens'
                <titleA Christmas Carol/> (1843) </head>
          </figure> The <gifigure/> element provides a means of wrapping one or more such
          elements together as a kind of graphic <soCalledblock/>. It may also include a
          brief description of the image: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                        ><figure
              ><graphic url="images/fezzipic.png"/>
              <headMr Fezziwig's Ball/>
              <figDescA Cruikshank engraving showing Mr Fezziwig leading a group of
                revellers./>
            </figure>
                    </egXML>
        </p>
        <pThese cases should be carefully distinguished from the case where an encoded text is
          complemented by a collection of digital images, maintained as a distinct resource. The
            ><attfacs/> attribute may be used to associate any element in an encoded text with a
          digital facsimile of it. In the simplest case, the <attfacs/> attribute on the
            <gipb/> element may be used to supply a location for an image file corresponding
          with that point in the text: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
            ><div
              ><pb facs="page1.png" n="1"/>
              <!-- text contained on page 1 is encoded here -->
              <pb facs="page2.png" n="2"/>
              <!-- text contained on page 2 is encoded here -->
            </div>
          </egXML> This method is only appropriate in the simple case where each digital image file
            <identpage1.png/> etc. corresponds with a single transcribed and encoded page. If
          multiple images are provided for each page, or more detailed alignment of image and
          transcription is required, for example because the image files actually represent double
          page spreads, more sophisticated mechanisms are needed, as further discussed in <ptr target="#Simple-fax"/> below. </p>
      </div>
      <div xml:id="Simple-anal"
        ><headAnalysis/>
        <div
          ><headOrthographic Sentences/>
          <pInterpretation typically ranges across the whole of a text, with no particular respect
            to other structural units. A useful preliminary to intensive interpretation is therefore
            to segment the text into discrete and identifiable units, each of which can then bear a
            label for use as a sort of ><soCalledcanonical reference/>. To facilitate such
            uses, these units may not cross each other, nor nest within each other. They may
            conveniently be represented using the following element: <specList
              ><specDesc key="s"/>
            </specList>
                    </p>
          <pAs the name suggests, the ><gis/> element is most commonly used (in linguistic
            applications at least) for marking <termorthographic sentences/>, that is, units
            defined by orthographic features such as punctuation. For example, the passage from
              <titleJane Eyre/> discussed earlier might be divided into s-units as follows:
              <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                            ><div type="chapter" n="38"
                ><pb n="474"/>
                <p
                                    ><s n="001"Reader, I married him./>
                                    <s n="002"A quiet wedding we had:/>
                                    <s n="003"he and I, the parson and clerk, were alone present./>
                                    <s n="004"When
                    we got back from church, I went into the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary

                                </p>
                <p
                                    ><q
                                        ><s n="005"Mary, I have been married to Mr Rochester this morning./>
                                    </q> ...
                </p>
              </div>
                        </egXML> Note that <gis/> elements cannot nest: the beginning of one
              <gis/> element implies that the previous one has finished. When s-units are tagged
            as shown above, it is advisable to tag the entire text end-to-end, so that every word in
            the text being analyzed will be contained by exactly one <gis/> element, whose
            identifier can then be used to specify a unique reference for it. If the identifiers
            used are unique within the document, then the <attxml:id/> attribute might be used
            in preference to the <attn/> attribute used in the above example.</p>

        <div
          ><headWords and Punctuation/>
          <pTokenization, that is, the identification of lexical or non-lexical tokens within a
            text, is a very common requirement for all kinds of textual analysis, and not an
            entirely trivial one. The decision as to whether, for example, ><qcan't/> in English
            or <qdu/> in French should be treated as one word or two is not simple. Consequently
            it is often useful to make explicit the preferred tokenization in a marked up text. The
            following elements are available for this purpose: <specList
              ><specDesc key="w"/>
              <specDesc key="c"/>
              <specDesc key="pc"/>
            </specList>
                    </p>
          <pFor example, the output from a part of speech tagger might be recorded in TEI simplePrint as
            follows: ><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
              ><s n="1"
                ><w ana="#NP0"Marley/>
                <w ana="#VBD"was/>
                <w ana="#AJ0"dead/>
                                <pc:/>
                <w ana="#TO0"to/>
                <w ana="#VBB"begin/>
                <w ana="#PRP"with/>
                <pc ana="#SENT"./>
              </s>
                        </egXML>
          </p>
          <pIn this example, each token in the input has been decorated with an automatically
            generated part of speech code, using the ><attana/> attribute discussed in section
              <ptr target="#xatts"/> above. The system has also distinguished between tokens to be
            treated as words (tagged <giw/>) and tokens considered to be punctuation (tagged
              <gipc/>). It may also sometimes be useful to distinguish tokens which consist of a
            single letter or character: the <gic/> element is provided for this purpose.
            <!-- some crazy people mark up interword space with a c: shd that be mentioned? -->
          </p>
          <pThe ><giw/> also provides for each word to be associated with a root form or lemma,
            either explicitly using the <attlemma/> attribute, or by reference, using the
              <attlemmaRef/> attribute, as in this example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"...><w ana="#VBD" lemma="be" lemmaRef="http://www.myLexicon.com/be"was/> ... </egXML>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div
          ><headGeneral-Purpose Interpretation Elements/>
          <pThe ><giw/> element is a specialisation of the <giseg/> element which has
            already been introduced for use in identifying otherwise unmarked targets of cross
            references and hypertext links (see section <ptr target="#Simple-ptrs"/>); it can be
            used to distinguish any portion of text to which the encoder wishes to assign a
            user-specified <atttype/> or a unique identifier; it may thus be used to tag
            textual features for which there is no other provision in the published TEI
            Guidelines.</p>
          <pFor example, the TEI Guidelines provide no ><soCalledapostrophe/> element to
            mark parts of a literary text in which the narrator addresses the reader (or hearer)
            directly. One approach might be to regard these as instances of the <giq/> element,
            distinguished from others by an appropriate value for the <attwho/> attribute. A
            possibly simpler, and certainly more general, solution would however be to use the
              <giseg/> element as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                            ><div type="chapter" n="38"
                ><p
                                    ><seg type="apostrophe"Reader, I married him./> A quiet wedding we had:
                  ...</p>
              </div>
                        </egXML> The <atttype/> attribute on the <giseg/> element can take any
            value, and so can be used to distinguish phrase-level phenomena of any kind; it is good
            practice to record the values used and their significance in the TEI header or in the
            documentation of the encoding system. <!-- mention ODD! -->

        ><headCommon Attributes/>

            <pAll text divisions, whether in front matter or elsewhere, may begin and end with one

            <pTEI simplePrint also provides elements for some additional components of front or back
              matter which are characteristic of particular kinds of text, in particular old play
              texts. These often include lists of dramatis personae and notes about the setting of a
              play, for which the following elements are provided: ><specList
                ><specDesc key="castList"/>
                <specDesc key="castItem"/>
                <specDesc key="castGroup"/>

            <pNote that these elements are intended for use in marking up cast lists and setting

        <pAs mentioned in section ><ptr target="#Simple-figs"/> above, a TEI simplePrint document may
          reference a set of page images, alone, or in combination with a transcription. For ease of
          management, it is strongly recommended that the <gigraphic/> elements representing
          those page images be grouped together within a <gifacsimile/> element, as in the
          following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                        ><facsimile
              ><graphic url="page1.png" xml:id="page1"/>
              <graphic url="page2.png" xml:id="page2"/>
            </facsimile>
                    </egXML> If a transcription is supplied in addition, the <attxml:id/>
          values can be used to align the page breaks within it with the relevant image, rather than
          using the URL given on the <gigraphic/> element. <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                        ><text
              ><!-- ...-->
              <pb facs="#page1"/>
              <!-- text contained on page 1 -->
              <pb facs="#page2"/>
              <!-- text contained on page 2 -->
              <!-- ...-->
            </text>
          </egXML>
        </p>
        <pThe ><gisurface/> element is useful in two situations: when it is desired to group
          different images of the same page, for example of different resolutions; and when it is
          desired to align parts of a page image with parts of a transcription. The <gizone/>
          element is used to define (and hence provide an identifier for) the location of a part of
          an image with reference to the surface on which it appears. </p>
        <pIn this example, a thumbnail and a high resolution image are associated with the same
          surface: ><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
            ><facsimile
              ><surface
                ><graphic xml:id="page1T" url="thumbs/page1.png"/>
                <graphic xml:id="page1" url="page1.png"/>
              </surface>
            </facsimile>
                    </egXML>
        </p>
        <pIn this example, the ><gihead/> element in the transcription is aligned with the top
          half of a square image: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
            ><facsimile
              ><surface ulx="1" uly="1" lrx="4" lry="4"
                ><graphic url="page1.png" xml:id="page1"/>
                <zone xml:id="topHalfP1" ulx="1" uly="1" lrx="2" lry="4"/>
              </surface>
            </facsimile>
            <text
              ><body
                ><!-- ... -->

          </egXML>
        </p>
        <pA more detailed explanation of the use of these attributes and other associated elements
          is given in the full TEI Guidelines. />
      </div>
      <div xml:id="Simple-header"
        ><headThe Electronic Title Page/>
        <pEvery TEI text has a header which provides information analogous to that provided by the
          title page of printed text. The header is introduced by the element ><giteiHeader/> and
          has four major parts: <specList
            ><specDesc key="fileDesc"/>
            <specDesc key="encodingDesc"/>
            <specDesc key="profileDesc"/>
            <specDesc key="revisionDesc"/>
          </specList>
                </p>
        <p A corpus or collection of texts with many shared characteristics may have one header for
          the corpus and individual headers for each component of the corpus. In this case the
            ><atttype/> attribute indicates the type of header. <tagteiHeader
            type="corpus"/> introduces the header for corpus-level information.</p>
        <pSome of the header elements contain running prose which consists of one or more
            ><gip/>s. Others are grouped: <list
            ><itemElements whose names end in ><mentionedStmt/> (for statement) usually
              enclose a group of elements recording some structured information.</item>
            <itemElements whose names end in ><mentionedDecl/> (for declaration) enclose
              information about specific encoding practices.</item>
            <itemElements whose names end in ><mentionedDesc/> (for description) contain
              a prose description.</item>
          </list>
                </p>
        <div
          ><headThe File Description/>
          <pThe ><gifileDesc/> element is mandatory. It contains a full bibliographic
            description of the file with the following elements: <specList
              ><specDesc key="titleStmt"/>
              <specDesc key="editionStmt"/>
              <specDesc key="extent"/>

              <specDesc key="sourceDesc"/>
            </specList>
                    </p>
          <p A minimal TEI header has the following structure: ><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" valid="feasible"

            ><headTagging Declaration/>
            <pWhen it does not consist simply of a prose description, the ><gitagsDecl/> element
              may contain a number of more specialized elements providing additional information
              about how the document concerned has been marked up. The following elements may be
              used: <specList
                ><specDesc key="rendition"/>
                <specDesc key="namespace"/>
                <specDesc key="tagUsage"/>
              </specList>
            </p>
            <pHere is a simple example, showing how these elements may be used. It indicates the
              number of times the elements ><gihi/> and <gititle/> from the TEI namespace
              have been used in the document. It also documents how the way that the source document
              was originally printed has been represented using TEI tagging: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                ><tagsDecl partial="true"
                  ><rendition xml:id="rend-bo"font-weight:bold/>
                  <rendition xml:id="rend-it" selector="hi, title"font-style:italic/>
                  <namespace name="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
                    ><tagUsage gi="hi" occurs="467"/>
                    <tagUsage gi="title" occurs="45"/>
                  </namespace>
                </tagsDecl>
              </egXML>
            </p>
            <pThe ><girendition/> elements here contain fragments expressed in the W3C standard
              Cascading Stylesheets language (CSS). Their function here is to associate the
              particular styles concerned with an identifier (for example <identrend-bo/>)
              which can then be pointed to from elsewhere within the document by means of the
                <attrendition/> attribute mentioned in section <ptr target="#faces"/> above. To
              indicate, for example, that a particular name in the document was rendered in a bold
              font it might be tagged <tagname rendition="#rend-bo"/>. The <attselector/>
              attribute used in the preceding example is used to indicate once for all a default
              rendition value to be associated with several elements: in this example, unless
              otherwise indicated, it is assumed that the content of each <gihi/> and each
                <gititle/> element was originally rendered using an italic font. </p>
            <pFor TEI simplePrint, a large set of such rendition definitions has been predefined. The
              encoder is not therefore required to supply any detailed declarations, but can refer
              to the predefined list using the following list: ><list type="gloss"

            <pThe ><valsimple:/> prefix used here must be mapped to a location at which the
              full rendition declaration can be found, by default the XML source of the present
              document.</p>
            <p Full details of the way these elements may be used are provided in the relevant
              section of the TEI Guidelines (><ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/HD.html#HD57"/>).</p>

          <div xml:id="refsdecl"
            ><headReference, Prefix, and Classification Declarations/>
            <pThe ><girefsDecl/> element is used to document the way in which any standard
              referencing scheme built into the encoding works. In its simplest form, it consists of
              prose description.</p>
            <pExample: ><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                                ><refsDecl
                  ><pThe ><attn/> attribute on each <gidiv/> contains the canonical
                    reference for each division in the form XX.yyy where XX is the book number in
                    roman numeral and yyy is the section number in arabic.</p>
                  <pMilestone tags refer to the edition of 1830 as E30 and that of 1850 as E50./>
                </refsDecl>
                            </egXML>
            </p>
            <pThe ><gilistPrefixDef/> element contains one or more <giprefixDef/> elements,
              each defining a prefix which has been used to abbreviate references to other
              documents, for example as the value of a <atttarget/> or other pointing
              attribute. The definition provides information about how the prefix can be translated
              automatically into a full URL, as in the following example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                ><listPrefixDef
                  ><prefixDef ident="psn" matchPattern="([A-Z]+)" replacementPattern="http://www.example.com/personography.xml#$1"/>
                </listPrefixDef>
                            </egXML>
            </p>
            <pIn this case, a pointer value in the form ><valpsn:MDH/> would be translated to
                <codehttp://www.example.com/personography.xml#MDH/>. </p>
            <pThe ><giclassDecl/> element groups together definitions or sources for any
              descriptive classification schemes or <termtaxonomies/> used by other parts of
              the header. These schemes may be defined in a number of different ways, using one or
              more of the following elements: <specList
                ><specDesc key="taxonomy"/>
                <specDesc key="bibl"/>
                <specDesc key="category"/>
                <specDesc key="catDesc"/>
              </specList>
                        </p>
            <pIn the simplest case, the taxonomy may be defined by a bibliographic reference, as in
              the following example: ><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                                ><classDecl
                  ><taxonomy xml:id="LC-SH"
                    ><biblLibrary of Congress Subject Headings />
                  </taxonomy>
                </classDecl>
                            </egXML>
            </p>
            <pAlternatively, or in addition, the encoder may define a special purpose
              classification scheme, as in the following example: ><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                                ><taxonomy xml:id="B"
                  ><biblBrown Corpus/>

            </p>
            <pLinkage between a particular text and a category within such a taxonomy is made by
              means of the ><gicatRef/> element within the <gitextClass/> element, as
              described in the next section.</p>
          </div>
          <div xml:id="chardecl"
            ><headThe character declaration/>
            <pAs mentioned in section ><ptr target="#code"/> above, the element <gig/> is used
              to indicate the presence of a nonstandard character or glyph in a transcription, and
              to reference a definition or description of it in the Header. These definitions are
              provided by means of the following specialised elements given within the
                <gicharDecl/> component of the <giencodingDesc/>
              <specList
                ><specDesc key="char"/>
                <specDesc key="glyph"/>

                <specDesc key="mapping"/>
              </specList> For example, the alchemical symbol for air might be encoded where it
              appears in a text using a <gig/> element, whose <attref/> attribute might
              have a value <val#air/> to link to the following simple definition for the symbol
              concerned : <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                ><char xml:id="air"
                  ><charNameALCHEMICAL SYMBOL FOR AIR/>

                </char>
                            </egXML> Further details of these and related elements are provided in
              section <ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/WD.html#D25-20"/> of the

        <div xml:id="profDesc"
          ><headThe Profile Description/>
          <pThe ><giprofileDesc/> element gathers together information about various descriptive
            aspects of a text. It has the following optional components: <specList
              ><specDesc key="creation"/>
              <specDesc key="abstract"/>
              <specDesc key="particDesc"/>

              <specDesc key="textClass"/>
            </specList>
                    </p>
          <pThe ><gicreation/> element documents where a work was created, even though it may
            not have been published or recorded there:</p>
          <pExample: ><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                            ><creation

                            </creation>
                        </egXML>
          </p>
          <pThe ><giabstract/> element may be used to provide a brief summary or abstract of the
            document concerned. It is most usually applied to texts born digital: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
              ><profileDesc
                ><abstract
                  ><pThis paper is a draft studying various aspects of using the TEI as a reference

              </profileDesc>
            </egXML>
          </p>
          <pThe ><giparticDesc/> element is used to list descriptive information about the real
            or fictional participants in a text, for example the characters in a novel or a play. It
            contains at least one <gilistPerson/> element, which contains individual
              <giperson/> elements.<specList
              ><specDesc key="listPerson"/>
              <specDesc key="person"/>
            </specList> For example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
              ><profileDesc
                ><particDesc

                    </person>
                    <person xml:id="GRM"
                      ><p
                                                ><nameMr Gryll/>: named for the mythical Gryllus, one of Ulysses'
                        sailors transformed by Circe into a pig, who argues that he was happier in
                        that state than as a man.</p>
                    </person>
                  </listPerson>
                </particDesc>
              </profileDesc>
            </egXML>
          </p>
          <pIn the same way, the ><gisettingDesc/> element can be used to list descriptive
            information about the real or fictional places mentioned in a text. It contains at least
            one <gilistPlace/> element, which contains individual <giplace/> elements. <specList
              ><specDesc key="listPlace"/>
              <specDesc key="place"/>
            </specList> For example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
              ><profileDesc
                ><settingDesc
                  ><listPlace
                    ><headHouses mentioned in ><titlePride and Prejudice/>
                                        </head>
                    <place xml:id="NETF1"
                      ><p
                                                ><nameNetherfield Park/>: home of the Bingleys</p>
                    </place>
                    <place xml:id="PEMB1"
                      ><p
                                                ><namePemberley/>: home of Mr Darcy</p>
                    </place>
                  </listPlace>
                </settingDesc>
              </profileDesc>
            </egXML>
          </p>
          <pThe full TEI Guidelines provide a rich range of additional elements to define more
            structured information about persons and places; these are not however available in TEI
            Simple./>
          <pThe ><gilangUsage/> element is useful where a text contains many different
            languages. It may contain <gilanguage/> elements to document each particular
            language used: <specList
              ><specDesc key="language"/>
            </specList> For example, a text containing predominantly text in French as spoken in
            Quebec, but also smaller amounts of British and Canadian English might be documented as
            follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                            ><langUsage
                ><language ident="fr-CA" usage="60"Québecois/>
                <language ident="en-CA" usage="20"Canadian Business English/>
                <language ident="en-GB" usage="20"British English/>
              </langUsage>
            </egXML>
          </p>
          <pThe ><gitextClass/> element classifies a text. This may be done with reference to a
            classification system locally defined by means of the <giclassDecl/> element, or by
            reference to some externally defined established scheme such as the Universal Decimal
            Classification. Texts may also be classified using lists of keywords, which may
            themselves be drawn from locally or externally defined control lists. The following
            elements are used to supply such classifications: <specList
              ><specDesc key="classCode"/>
              <specDesc key="catRef"/>
              <specDesc key="keywords"/>
            </specList>
          </p>
          <pThe simplest way of classifying a text is by means of the ><giclassCode/> element.
            For example, a text with classification 410 in the Universal Decimal Classification
            might be documented as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
              ><classCode scheme="http://www.udc.org"410/>
            </egXML>
          </p>
          <pWhen a classification scheme has been locally defined using the ><gitaxonomy/>
            element discussed in the preceding subsection, the <gicatRef/> element should be
            used to reference it. To continue the earlier example, a work classified in the Brown
            Corpus as <valPress reportage - Sunday/> and also as <valReligion/> might be
            documented as follows: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
              ><catRef target="#B.A3 #B.D"/>
            </egXML>
          </p>
          <pThe element ><gikeywords/> contains one or more keywords or phrases identifying the
            topic or nature of a text, each tagged as a <giterm/>. As usual, the attribute
              <attscheme/> identifies the source from which these terms are taken. For example,
            if the LC Subject Headings are used, following declaration of that classification system
            in a <gitaxonomy/> element as above: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                            ><textClass
                ><keywords scheme="#LCSH"
                  ><termEnglish literature/>
                  <termHistory and criticism/>
                  <termData processing./>
                </keywords>
              </textClass>
                        </egXML>
          </p>
          <pMultiple classifications may be supplied using any of the mechanisms described in this
            section./>
        </div>
        <div
          ><headOther forms of metadata/>
          <pThe TEI header was one of the first attempts to provide a full range of metadata
            elements, but it is by no means the only standard now used for this purpose. To
            facilitate the management of large digital collections and to simplify interoperability
            of TEI and non-TEI resources, the following element may be found useful: ><specList
              ><specDesc key="xenoData"/>
            </specList>
                    </p>
          <pA typical use for this element might be to store a set of descriptors conforming to the
            Dublin Core standard in the TEI header rather than to generate them automatically from
            the corresponding TEI elements. For examples and discussion, see the TEI Guidelines at
              ><ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/HD.html#HD9"/>
                    </p>
        </div>
        <div
          ><headThe Revision Description/>
          <pThe ><girevisionDesc/> element provides a change log in which each significant
            change made to a text may be recorded. It is always the last element in a
              <giteiHeader/> and contains the following elements: <specList
              ><specDesc key="change"/>
              <specDesc key="listChange"/>
            </specList>
          </p>
          <pEach ><gichange/> element contains a brief description of a significant change. The
            attributes <attwhen/> and <attwho/> may be used to identify when the change
            was carried out and the person responsible for it. </p>
          <pIt is good practice (but not required) to group changes together within a
              ><gilistChange/> element. </p>
          <pExample: ><egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"
                            ><revisionDesc
                ><listChange
                  ><change when="1991-11-11" who="#LB"deleted chapter 10/>
                  <change when="1991-11-02" who="#MSM"completed first draft/>
                </listChange>

          <pIn a production environment it will usually be found preferable to use some kind of
            automated system to track and record changes. Many such ><termversion control
              systems/>, as they are known, can also be configured to update the TEI header of
            a file automatically. </p>

        ><headThe Simple Processing Model/>
        <pUnlike most other TEI customizations, TEI simplePrint includes documentation of the intended
          processing associated with the majority of elements. As noted above, the TEI provides
          components such as the ><attrendition/> attribute to indicate the appearance of
          particular parts of a document in the non-digital source from which it is derived. With
          TEI simplePrint, it is also possible to indicate how in general an element should be processed,
          in particular its intended appearance when processed for display on a screen or on paper.
          This ability derives from a number of capabilities recently added to the TEI architecture
          for the specification of processing, which were developed as part of the project that
          defined the TEI simplePrint schema.</p>
        <pThe key feature of this ><soCalledProcessing Model/> is a notation that allows
          the encoder to associate each element with one or more categories, which we call its
            <termbehaviour/>s. In addition, the Processing Model indicates how the element
          should be rendered, possibly differently in differing circumstances, using the W3C
          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) mentioned above. It is consequently much easier to develop
          processors for documents conforming to TEI simplePrint, since the complexity of the task is
          much reduced.</p>
        <pTwenty-five different behaviours are currently defined by the TEI Processing Model. Their
          names indicate informally the categorization concerned, and should be readily
          comprehensible for most programmers. The following table indicates the TEI simplePrint elements
          associated with each:/>

                      ><pEEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the
                        publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the
                        image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database
                        (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy
                        (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published
                        between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO./>
                      <pEEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project
                        restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic
                        transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural
                        encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org)./>
                      <pThe EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during
                        Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January
                        2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we
                        respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original
                        source./>
                      <pUsers should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any
                        assumptions that can be made about the data./>
                      <pText selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature
                        (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then
                        their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide
                        variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the
                        period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although
                        there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and
                        sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling
                        reason to do so./>
                      <pImage sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic
                        encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and
                        Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for
                        accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be
                        redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters
                        marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per
                        text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as <gap>s. Understanding these
                        processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good,
                        some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible.
                        Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been
                        looked at by a TCP editor./>
                      <pThe texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the
                        TEI in Libraries guidelines./>
                      <pCopies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with
                        mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters
                        represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML
                        (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements)./>
